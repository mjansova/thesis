\section{introduction}
- mtoivation
	short conclusion of susy chapter - light stop, 1-lep, high xsection -> basic or sth more like Alex?
-signature  and possible decays
	SMS, T2TT, T2bW. T2tb, decay cascades, feynam diagrams
-plane od delta M
	search in delta M plane

-general intro
	- I worked on more versions of analyses, but only one introfuced and than the differences, and then some chosen personal contribution

-delta M around top mass challenging kinematics -> looks like SM tt -> this region is called stealthy region
-for t2bW when W becomes on-shell also difficult kinematics

\section{search strategy}

-give general idea
	-overview

reduce SM background
binned approach in variables which tend to reduce signal

-variables
	MET significance?!
	MT -formula; suppress largely tt1l background; and also single top and W+jets; kinematic endpoint at W mass
	MT2W - formula; explanation; supress lost lepton (already suppressed by requiring no additional lepton, but not enough); tries to reconstruct the event under tt2l and one undetected lepton assumption; for signal large delta M leads to alrge MT2W, while small delta M has lage MT2W; endpoint at top mass
	tmod - formula; chi2 like variable how well the event agrees with tt2l hypothesis, similar behavior to Mt2W; removing some of the terms from oifficial topness helps the discrimination; works better at low jet multiplicities than MT2W
	min dphi (jet, MET) - formula
        Njets

-signal regions
	- first vertex in event pass the good quality criteria
	- pass one lepton selection
	- reject additional (veto) leptons
	- at least two jets
	-at leats one b-tag
	-MT>150
	-dphi>0.8
	+ compressed, boosted high delta M, low delta M, High delta M regions (in 2015)

-control regions

-backgrounds 
	what type of

-baseline selection
	exactly one good lepton
	MT, MET
	MT2W (2015) below and above 200GeV -> in compressed spectra the MT2W is small (similar to background), in large mass spliting it can strongly suppress tt2l
	3 or 4 jets - boosted topologies (2015)
        compressed spectra (2015) tmod instead of MT2W + two jets - jets are soft, the only visible ones are from b-tag hadronization

-binning in
	MET
	MT2W (2015)
	
-triggers
	single lepton and MET triggers
	double lepton - to check kinematics of lost lepton
	single photon - to check MET resolution

-MC samples
	fastsim

-objects and event selection
	vertex selection 
	lepton selection - high pt isolated lepton, no veto lepton to reduce tt2l
	isolated track veto - tracker isolation to avoid taus
	hadronic tau veto (2015) - additional to the isolation, or selects additional taus
	jets - ak4 (pt>30, eta<2.4), medium working point for btag(CsVv2) (2015)
	MET - sum of PF candidates, type-1 corrected - jet energy correction applied to the jets in MET calculation, MET filters

-SF, rewighting

-compressed spectra
	ISR jets
	recoil, enhance MET

\subsection{background estimation}

-data driven + simulation
-general idea
-MET extrapolation?
-transfer factors
-scale factors - take into account differences in lepton, b-tagging etc efficiency
-composition of backgrouns - percentage

\subsubsection{Z to nunu}

-ttZ, WZ, ZZ
-2015 dataset taken from simulation -> small stats
-large in high MET and MT2W regions

-2017
-ZZ still taken from simulation
-3l scale factor -> normalization

\subsection{single lepton}

-sensitive to MET and MT
-W+jets, tt1l
- tt1l -> constrained kinematics of W due to top, so MT tail is just due to MET resolution
-W+jets, no kinematics constraint, MT tail due to of shell W production (W width) 
-W+jets, zero b-tag control region
-tt1l -> negligible, estimation from simulation

-1 lep neutrino from W decay

ESTIMATIN:
-data driven, similar as for the lost lepton
-CR contamination N CR,data,Wjets,0btag = N CR,data,0btag - N CR,MC,ninWjets,0btag
-MET and NJET extrapolation (2015)
-W+b modelling systematics

\subsection{Lost lepton}
-dominant background after MET and MT selections
-tt2l wit both Ws decaying leptonically and one lepton lost
-largest contribution is the tt2l, then single top and then ttV and diboson processes.
-dilepton control region
-misreconstruction of lepton - 1 lepton and large MET
-two enutrinos lare MT and MT2W

ESTIMATON:
- N data,SR (ll) / N data,CR (ll) = N MC,SR (ll) / N MC,CR(ll) -> get N data,SR
-MET and Njet extrapolation (2015) -> additional transfer factor
-good modeling of njet and MET needed -> mismodelling in ssimu leads to mismodelling in TF -> special emu CR -> additional SF due to mismodelling
-gamma plus jets -> MET resolution > bin migrations - gamma pt spectrum reveighted to match neutrino pt spectrum, from reweighted events METmodified = reconstructed-MET + pTgamma


-systematics


\section{differences in previous analyses}

\section{selected topics}

\textbf{W-tagging}

-motivation
	high delta M regim - boost -> jets merge
-techniques
	larger radius jets
	tau ratios - N subjetiness
	different masses-> grooming techniques
	
-results
	end of 2015 - slide 8,9 - results on different ak8 W-tagging categories (18/11); lumi=2 1/fb
	mid of 2016 -update of previous study - lumi=2.26 fb; ak8+ak10 tagging; tables slide 7, 11 -> mo improvement with ak8, but slight improvement with ak10 

-results from Sicheng with top tagging
	-resolved top tagger - 3ak4 jets
	-second presentation (31/01 same as 12 feb?), slide 6 - interesting plot, slide 10,11 significance table
        -merged top tagger - boosted objects
		slide 4, 5, 6

\textbf{depndence of discriminating variables on nvertex}
-not much to say
