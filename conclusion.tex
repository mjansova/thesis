\chapternonum{Conclusion}

%TODO past/present

This thesis is divided into two parts, first part is dedicated to the CMS detector and especially the CMS silicon strip tracker. The studies and measurements in Chapter~\ref{sec:HIPch} were motivated by the observed inefficiencies in the tracking during the 2015 and 2016. The first analysis of this chapter performs study of the HIP events as a possible explanation of these inefficiencies. Shortly, it was realized that the HIP effect alone is not responsible for the inefficiencies in tracking, but not optimal settings of APVs was found the main cause of them.  The APV settings were quickly changed and second data were taken in order to perform analysis of the HIP events which does not suffer from the inefficiencies introduced by the APV settings. This fact and also the conditions of the data-taking has provided a possibility to perform a first HIP probability measurement at CMS. The HIP probability per pileup has been computed computed for each layer/wheel/ring of the silicon strip tracker and it has been found to be of the order of~$10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ depending on the tracker layer/wheel/ring. This analysis also focuses on the fake clusters induced by the HIP events. 

In Chapter~\ref{ch:simu} the simulation of clusters in the silicon strip tracker is discussed. The dependency of the cluster charge, seed charge and width on the parameters used in the simulation has been shown. It has been identified that the outdated cross talk parameters lead to the discrepancies of of the cluster seed charge and width description between data and simulation. This observation motivated the measurement of the cross talk parameters from the 2018 CRUZET VR data. Unfortunately, due to trigger condition, only cross talk in barrel could be measured and a new cross talk for the disks and endcaps had to be evaluated with help of both data and simulation. The new cross talk parameters improved largely the description of data by simulation in the cluster seed charge and cluster width and therefore they have been included into the official release of the CMS software.

The Chapter~\ref{sec:stopch} describes performed Run~2 searches for the top squark pair production in the single lepton final state and especially focuses on the analysis of the full 2016 dataset corresponding to the integrated luminosity of 35.9~fb$^{-1}$. This chapter discusses the whole analysis chain and highlights my contributions to this analysis. No excess from the standard model has been observed in any of the studied stop decay modes which are $\tilde{t}_{1} \to t  \tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1} $, $\tilde{t}_{1} \to b  \tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}$, and $ \tilde{t}_{1} \to t  \tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}/\tilde{t}_{1} \to b  \tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1} $ and therefore the exclusion limits has been derived in terms of simplified model spectra in the plane of the stop vs. LSP masses. The strongest limit on the stop masses has been obtained for the decay mode where both stops decay to b-quark and neutralino $\tilde{t}_{1} \to t  \tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$. In this case the full 2016 analysis is excluding the stop masses up to 1120~GeV for a massless LSP. This result is reaching the naturalness limit on the stop mass which was identified to be around 1~TeV. At the end of this chapter the naturalness bound is revisited and the constraints on the masses of the SUSY particles from the observed cold dark matter density are also discussed. The final thoughts are about the possibility of the SUSY theories beyond the MSSM.

%HIP
results
	-first studied the hi effect as a possible explanation of the inefficiencies
	-first study with the CMS data, studied the evolution of baseline and raw digis standard deviation and with their help designed the selection of the HIP, it was found out that the HIP leads to the low baseline and low rms raw what was also observed in the 2nd study provided opportunity to study data not affecte dby the ineffeicincies
	-the HIP effect affects the cluster charge and multiplicity and in the first study a decrease in the cluster multiplicity form average, i.e. dead time, is observed for aroun 250 ns.
	-Due to the data-taking properties the deadtime cannot be studied in data after vfp fix, but with these data we have shown that there is an increased multiplicity of fake clusters after a HIP event. But in average this multiplicity is of the same order of magnitude as the cluster multiplicity of fake clusters when no HIP is present. We have also estimated a lower bound on the probability that a fake cluster from a HIP event is reconstructed into track to be 0.002\%. We observed that these fake clusters originate from the baseline distortiond induced by the HIP event. 
	-We have computed that the hip probability per pileup for each layer/wheel/ring of the silicon strip tracker and it has been found to be of the order of~$10^{-4}-10^{-3}$\% depending on the tracker layer/wheel/ring. This means that in case of dead time for 250ns and bunch spacing of 25ns the PU of order of $10^4-10^5$  would cause that the APV chip is never fully efficient (ask prob of 10 events before have a HIP) and we are far from that now.
 
is there something to be improved
	-different design of the APV chip. The common powering of inverters causes the drop o baseline but o the other hand it stabilizes the baseline. The resistance of the inverter resistor was changed in order to improve the sensitivity to the HIP event, but it enhances the instabilities of baseline, the basline distrotion, leading to a possible enhancement of the fake cluster reconstruction.

does it need to be monitored
	-the HIP probability is now low and tehrefore does not cause a large problems. But once the PU is increasing it can become dangerous, but as I mentioned the PU would have to be of the order of... which is far from teh expected PU at LHC.
 
how to improve ?
	-increase of lumi, increase of PU > for HL-LHC there is a development of new chips and therefore in their design we need to pay attention to the HIP effect (does somebody already thinking about that)

could we prevent by changing baseline ref value ?
	-the HIP was tried to be mitigated by maximizing CMN. But it was found out taht this maximization elads ony to the appearance of the so-called "anomalous cluster" (more details in HitEffLoss page). This check was though done before the APV change and should be redone. But the problem is that due to the HIP tehre are also fragments causing clusters plus fakes from distrotions which would not be normally reconstructed as they are below zero. So would it be the right thing to do?  %slide 27: https://indico.cern.ch/event/470862/contributions/1146979/attachments/1281240/1903454/common_mode_maximization.pdf

will we suffer of this at HL-LHC ?
we will ahve a HIP effect but it consequences, the induced dead time and probability will depend on the design of modules.

something about the APV conditions?
Preamp Feedback Voltage Bias (VFP) Change
not much to say...

the common biasing scheme of inverters -> stabilize baseline but xtalk effect -> could reduce the HIP problem - check

%SIMU
does it need to be remeasured
do we need a different data
how can we improve the emasurement and the physics
can we introduce some new things in simu
are there some problematic things in simualtion
do we need to change something more frequently or completely because the sensor changes with radiation
what remains unchanged
pulse shape problematics -> the OOT is not well described
xtalk independent of time in simu
measure it at HLLHC?
what are the limitations ?
why outdated ? talk about irradation
cross talk: Said somewhere that it was done last time in 2010 ?
Do we know why it was modified ?
Should we plan to measure it later this run or at run III ?
What should be the next step ?
What about cross-talk in the future detector ?
How to understand the change of cross talk, which goes in opproite direction, can we disentangle it by more frequent measurements?
