\chapternonum{Introduction}

The knowledge about particle physics brought us many inventions widely used and appreciated in the society. The particle physics applications are now used in many fields, from medicine to the energy industry. To further understand and broaden our knowledge about the elementary particles and interactions, the Large Hadron Collider was built at CERN. The Large Hadron Collidier is providing a collision in four detectors, one of them being the Compact Muon Solenoid~(CMS). In the detector the colliding particles interact, leading to the creation of new particles which are traversing the detector and leaving there the energy deposits on their path. To be able to precisely reconstruct the picture about what happened in the detector, precise measurement of these deposits is required.

The first Chapter~\ref{sec:detch} briefly introduces the Large Hadron Collidier and Compact Muon Solenoid, giving more detailed information about areas which are further developped in the following chapters. This chapter also discusses the reconstruction of the physics objects seen in the detector.

In Chapter~\ref{sec:HIPch} we discuss the strip tracker of the Compact Muon Solenoid and observed inefficiencies during years 2015 and 2016, in the reconstruction of particle paths due to its unability to measure the energy deposits. This effect was believed to be caused by the inelastic nuclear interactions in the sensitive volume of the tracker, which lead to the saturation of the tracker eleectronics. This chapter presents results on the probability of the nuclear interactions and effects resulting from such interactions. 

The third Chapter~\ref{ch:simu} as well focuses on the silicon tracker of the Compact Muon Solenoid, but in this case on its simulation. In order to be able to compare the results of the experiment with the theoretical expectation, the simulation of the intraction of the generated particles according to the theoretical mdoel with the detector must be simulated. This chapter describes how the simulation in the strip tracker is implemented and how it can be improved. At the end we present results on measurement of the tracker properties which are taken as a parameters in the simulation. And we show how intorducing these parameteres into simulation improved the desription of data by simulation at the level of energy deposits.

The particle physics is described by the standard model, which last piece, the Higgs bosonWith the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 by the CMS and ATALS collaborations, the model of the particle which was the last undiscovered Although the standard model is now completed and in generall well describing the physics phenomena, it sufferes from several shortcomings. This issue makes us belive that the standard models is and effective theory, which is a part of a bigger theory. Over years, many theories  were proposed and one, referred to as supersymmetry, became of a special interest because it is addressing  many of the standard model shortocimgs. Both standard model and supersymmetry are discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:SUSYch}.

The supersymmetry introduces a new partner to each standard model particle and therefore extensive searches for these particles are performed by the CMS collaboration. One of these particle is supersymmetric partner of the top quark which is expected to have a mass around 1~TeV and therefore be accesible at the LHC energies. The last Chapter~\ref{sec:stopch} before conclusion presents search for this supersymmetric partner of the top quark in the single lepton final state.
