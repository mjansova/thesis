increase of instantaneous luminosity
 With increasing instantaneous luminosity we observe:

    lower cluster charge
    lower S/N
    lower hit efficiency
    shorter tracks
    lower track efficiency 

-tracks fewer hits:
- hit inefficiency
-reduced cluster charge
-relaxed? cluster charge cut? _> there is a change, different procedure
-less tracks in  2015RunD tahn in MC, not visinle in RunC  !!!
-The effect is lumi dependent, but also BX dependent (electronics recovers during gaps)


%-------------------------
actions taken
%------------------------
-discussion with the people who created APV etc
-simulation: HIP math model, function and fit code -> mitigation
-recontruction: Recipe How to Reconstruct VirginRaw Data and reco datasets (new ZS, e.g. iterative median etc)
-Inefficient modules identification/Classification in VR data -identify modules with missing hit and categorize what is happening
-hit efficiency studies
-impact of HIP on cluster charge and S/N 
-adjusting the baseline level: in order not to be that much sensitive to teh drop, did not help, only spurious clusters from noise appeared
-Evolution of mean cluster charge with bx, with old and new APV settingsi (as a function of time, bx, inst lumi, etc...)
-parameters in APV - considering change

HIP on the physics:
%-------------------------

Jet/MET
- shorter tracks are ok, no big problems for jet and met at first -> nothing seen as a function of BX
- there is only small effect for plow pT jets
- but then: Large MET tails arising from iterations in muon tracking steps, which lead to spurious muon or charged hadron with high pt and large error
	- reconstruction issue influencing both data and MC
	- main source: not high purity tracks in PF algorithm
	- this causes problems to analyses with a lot of fake MET (fully hadronic searches) or high pt muon searches
	-> bad muon filter + bad charged hadron filter    
- problem with JEC - probably problem with photon energy scale

Muon:
-medium and tight muon ID efficiency -> drop with the inst lumi -> significant impact
-muon tracking efficiency drop -> not seen in MC
-nr of primary vertices drop -> not seen in MC

Electron:
-electron ID seems not to be much influenced

Tau:
-some effect, but well mitigated with changes in tarcking

- hit multiplicity and selected tracks multiplicity disagreement between data and simu
- an effect up to 10\% on the SV reconstruction
-disagreement in number of b-tagged jets
-> problems with scale factors, dependent on luminosity
-> mitigation - improved track selection, relaxin  number of hits in strip tracker, while keepinh nr of hits in pixels high
- 0.65 b tagging efficiency without hip, with hip up to only 0.5
