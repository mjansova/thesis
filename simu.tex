\section{CMS simulation}

The simulated samples are vital part of many analyses. For the physics analyses purposes they are used to copmare the theoretical signal and background with the measured data.  Further, the simulations are also important in development and understaning of specific analysis methods and in derivation and valiadation of calibrations, efficiencies and resolutions.

The CMS simulation workflow~\cite{Banerjee:2007zz, Hildreth:2017vpw, Hildreth:2015kps, website:simuBasics } is divided into several steps. At the beginning of the simulation chain the physics events are generated and then the generated final state particles are sent through the simulated detector. Following step is the simulation of response of electron electronics to particle traversing the detector. The otput of this producedure are RAW data, which can be later reconstructed and slimmed for the purposes of physics analyses. The overview of the simulation steps, which will be described in larger detail in following subsections, can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/SimulationFlow}~\cite{website:simuBasics}. The production of the simulated samples is handled centrally~\cite{Boudoul:2015bkp} by the CMS collaboration.

The four-vectors of generated particles together with the detector description enter to the Geant4 simulation which output are simulated hits in the detector volume. Optionally the simulated hits from pile-up interactions can be added on top of the simulated hist from physics and the mixture of these hits are digitized in the electronics simulation. In this step the description of the electronics, for eaxample the noise and detector conditions, for example the temperature, is added. The output of digitization are RAW data~\cite{website:simuBasics}. }

\subsection{Monte Carlo event generators}

The Monte Carlo~(MC) generators are basic tool designed to produce physics events according to a physics model. In the majority of cases three kinds of generators are used in CMS~\cite{website:generation, website:generationIntro}. 

\textbf{General-purpose generators}
These are for example Pythia8~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} or Herwig++~\cite{Bahr:2008pv}. The provide the best possible description of the result of the proton collision. To generate outgoing particles originating from the interaction of colliding particles, many theoretical models and aspects has to be plugged in the generation process, such as the description of soft and hard interactions~(in leading order), parton distribution functions~(PDFs), initial and final state radiation~(ISR and FSR), multiple parton interactions, hadronization of partons and decay of particles~\ref{}.

\textbf{Matrix Element calculators}
The generators such as Powheg~\cite{Oleari:2010nx} or MadGraph5\_aMCatNLO~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} were developed to provide next-to-leading order~(NLO) claculations. These calculators give the final state description on the parton level which needs to be plugged into one of the general-purpos generators to proceed with  the full hadronization.

\textbf{Specific generators}
These genrators are used to generate specific kind of events e.g. diffractive or cosmic events.


\subsection{Detector simulation}

To be able to compare the data and simulations, the generated particles need  to be propagated through the volume of detector. This is achieved via GEANT4~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh ,Lefebure:1999wja} toolkit into which detailed description of the CMS detector, its active and dead material dimensions, hierarchy and properties, is plugged. The GEANT4 sends the generated particles through the detector and simulates the interactions with material and modells the physics processes which happen during the passage of the particles through detector. The output of this procedure are simulated hits left by particles interacting with the active volumes of the subdetectors. The simulated hits can originate from primary particles generated by the MC generator, or from the secondary particles which are result of the GEANT4 simulation process.

The simulation of the pile-up events is done separately from the simulation of the events of interests. The input to  the GEANT4 simulation of in-time and out-of-time pile-up is pool of Minimum Bias single interaction events.

This full simulation~(FullSim) is very time intensive and thus it is not suitable to simulate samples for which huge number of events is needed. For this purposes the fast simulation~(FastSim)~\cite{Sekmen:2017hzs, CMS:2010spa, Giammanco:2014bza} was developed as an alternative to the FullSim. The FastSim uses simplified detector geometry and interactions with material, what speeds the simulation by factor of around 100. The comparison of physics objects of FullSim and FastSim shows that FastSim is reliable alternative that reproduces the FullSim with around 10\% accuracy~\cite{Abdullin:2011zz, Sekmen:2017hzs} The FastSim is widely used to produce for example Supersymmetry samples, where large scans with different parameter values are needed. 

\subsection{Simulation of the detector response to the particle signal}

To obtain clusters, the signal from the GEANT4 and the response of the readout electronics to this signal. This step is called a digitization and its input is merged collection of physics events of interest and pile-up events. There are three domains providing digitization of given siubdetectors, which are SimTracker, SimCalorimetry and SimMuon~\cite{iwebsite:simdigi}. The digitized saples are in the RAW format and can be further reconstrcuted in a similar way as data.

\section{Simulation of the silicon strip tracker response to the particle signal}

In order to be able to use the simulated samples for the physics analyses puroposes and to be able to rely on them, the simulated samples have to describe the data as well as possible. In case of tracker, the output of the standard simulation are Zero Suppressed data, which are further reconstructed into clusters during the reconstruction step. These clusters are used for tracking and physics objects reconstruction, therefore best possible description of data by simulated samples at clusters level is vital.

In following figures, data and simulation comparison of several important clustaer quantities is shown. For the comparison, the zero bias data sample is from run 305064 and fill 6298, is used. The produced simulated sample is minimum biasi produced in FullSim configuration. Both data and simulaten were produced in deconvolution mode. To avoid fake clusters and clusters originating from pile-up, only clusters associated with tracks are used to create plots in whole chapter.
 
The cluster charge collected by one module divided by length of track in sensor, further referred as cluster charge, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0}. The data to simulation ratio fluctuates around one within around $\pm 10\%$ in the bulk of  the cluster charge distribution, but the description worsens for very small and very large cluster charges. Overall the cluster charge distribution is more narrow than in data.

                 { (top) Data and simulation  comparison of cluster charge. The simulated distribution is rescaled to number of clusters in data. (bottom) Data to simulation ratio of cluster charge distributions. }

The cluster width depends on the sensor geometry and therefore has to be shown separately for different geometries. The possible geometries and their location can be found in Tab.~\ref{tab:trackerGeometries}. The data to simualtion comparison for inner and ouer barrel geomtries is shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:figures/widthTOB}~and~\ref{fig:figures/widthTIB}. In all cases there is very poor description of cluster width in data by the simulation. The mentioned dependency of cluster width on the geometry can be seen when comparing cluster width between IB1 and IB2 in Fig.~\ref{figures/widthTIB}. The IB1 sensors have smaller pitch with respect to IB2 and therefore the IB1 clusters are in average wider, as in case of IB1 larger number of strips would collect charge from the same track. The sensors of IB2 and OB1 have similar pitch, but OB1 sensors are thicker which leads to larger cluster width than in case of IB2, because the particle path in a sensor is longer. Morover the cross talk is larger for OB1 than IB2, leading to larger enhancement in OB1 cluster width compared to IB2.

The other important quantity describing cluster, is charge of the strip reading the most of the charge from all strips in cluster rescaled to track path in sensor, which is later reffered as cluster seed charge.The cluster seed chargei in Figs.~\ref{seedTOB}~and~\ref{seedTIB} is again dependent on the module geometry and therefore is shown for four different geometries. In the plots it can be seen that in all cases the simulation in average predicts lower cluster seed charge and there is a clean trend in data to simulation ratio. It can be als observed thato with larger pitch, the seed charge increases as the charge from larger part of sensitive volume is read by one strip. Moreover difference for IB2 and OB1 are observed. These two ahve simillar pitch size, but the cross talk is larger for OB2, leading to smaller seed charge.

To summarize, in general the simulation tend to overestimate the cluster width, but on the other hand underestimate the charge of the seed strip. Overall the simulation of cluster charge agree with data within $\pm$10\% over a wide range of cluster charges.  

To understand how the clusters are simulated and what part of simulation can lead to incorrecti cluster simulation, first the simulation flow has to be described. To simulate clusters in the tracker, first the GEANT4 energy deposits have to be converted to charge carriers and then propagated through the sensor and collected by the strips. To achieve good data and simulation agreement, the propagation has to be corrected for effects which happen physcially in the sensor, for example a diffusion. Other set of factors is applied on top of the simulated signal to mimic effects of electronics on the signal acquired during the data-taking. Signal with all corrections applied, is digitized. The flow of the simulation steps is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:trackerSimulationFlow}. In the following subsections these steps are described in detail, and later, potential issues in the simulation approach are indentified and discussed. Later, for simplicity, in majority of cases the cluster seed and with distributions are shown only for OB2. As the standard data-taking mode is Zero Supperssion with APVs operating in deconvolution mode, the simualtion steps are described in these conditions. Other possibiltites will be shortly discussed as well.

\subsection{Signal simulation steps}

%TODO naming convention! digitization or simulation?

\subsubsection{GEANT4 output}

A simulated hit in the tracker produced by GEANT4 is stored in class called CMSTrackerHit~\cite{Lefebure:1364020}. The CMSTrackerHit is created for each particle entering tracker and for each sensitive detector unit. In case of silicon strip tracker one sensitive detector unit is one side of sensors of one module. The CMSTrackerHit stores information about particle entry and exit point in the reference system of the detector unit, the energy of an particle at an entrance point, total amount of energy deposited in the detector unit, the time for which particle existed before it entered detector unit and the identification of detector unit and the track. A sketch of a detector unit and information stored by GEANT4 is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/geantDeposit}. In later text, the detector unit will be reffered as module.

%~\cite{website:simuBasics}. }

\subsubsection{Divide energy deposit}

The GEANT4 hit stores the point-like total energy deposited in one module. Depending on the arrival time of particle to the module, different fraction of the charge will be read. Later the particle arrives, smaller fraction of charge is collected. To determine the delay of particle with respect of particle going at speed-of-light, time of filight of particle to given module is compared with time-of-fligt of photon to that module. According to delay between particle and photon it is determined, how far from the maximum of the  peak or deconvolution puls shape the particle signal is read and consequently the charge deposited is reduced between the puls shape value at maximum and reading time. The shchema of this time response to the signal can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/timeResponse}.


    \insertFigure{figures/timeResponse} % Filename = label
                 {0.5}       % Width, in fraction of the whole page width
                 { The puls shape plugged into the simulation. The 0~ns correspond to the reference time, when all charge is collected.  }

In the real data-taking the energy deposition is not point-like, but the track looses its energy continuously as it traverses the module. To mimic this, the track is divided to a certain number of equdistand segments. Currently the number of sectors is evaluated as a fixed factor multiplied by expected number of strips reading a signal. The rescaled total charge is then divided to the track segments and for each segment is fluctuated according Landau function. The fluctuated charge per segment is then nomrlized to keep the sum of the segment energies equal to the intial energy loss. The local corrdinates of the track segment together with the fluctuated normalized energy deposit is saved in energy deposit unit.

In this procedure there are several simplification which can lead to discrepancies in properties of simulated and generated clusters. The GEANT4 provides only the total charge deposited, therefore the charge has to be divided between the discreet and equidistant tracks segments, what is still not corresponding to reallity. Moreover it is assumed that the energy loss is constant along the track, but in reality there is an evolution of the energy loss with the particle momentum.

The charge of each track segment is being fluctuated by GEANT4 routine. This routine is initiazed with a parameter specifing a cutoff on the delta ray production. The delta rays are already part of previous GEANT4 output and therefore this cutoff has to be the same one as the one in the previous step in order to avoid mismatch. The dependency of cluster charge, cluster seed charge and cluster width on the deltra ray cutoff, which was varied up to $\pm 20\%$ around its default value of 0.120425, is shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:figures/clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0DeltaProdCut}~and~\ref{fig:figures/seedwidthTOBDeltaProdCut}. From the figures it can be concluded that in the given range of the cutoff variation, the change of distributions of the cluster properties is almost neglilible.

The deconvolution puls shape used in simulation, presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/timeResponse}, was determined by parametrization of results obtained in~\cite{Delaere:1061284}. These results were obtained from laster tests of the TOB modules. Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/timeResponseReal} presents the results, when single srip was hit by the laser. In this plot the resulting puls shape from the hit strip and two neighbors on each side is shown. The neigboring strips have non-zero charge purely due to the cross talk effect. As mentioned in pervious chapter, there are two main sources of cross talk. First is caused by the fact, that when charge carriers are moving inside the sensor, they are inducing charge on more strips, not only the hit one. The second source is electronis cross talk which is result of coupling strips via inter-strip capacitance as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/capacitanceNetwork}. 

%By default, cross talk in this chapter means capacitive coupling between strips.

It can be noticed that there are eveveral differences between the puls shapes. First, the maxima of puls shapes are not same for the hit strip and for its neighbor. This fact is ommited from the simulation. Secondly, the puls shape can have negative values in reallityt, while it is not a case for simulation. Thirdly a puls shape does not take into account the charge trapping in the sensors induced by radiation or any other aging efects of the modules of the CMS tracker. Moreover in 2016 the VFP parameter changed in order to avoid saturation of electronics, which resulted in a change of the puls shape~\cite{website:vfp}. This change did not propagate into the simulation.

Furthemore there is a large part of dynamics which modifies the puls shaped not modelled in the simulation. The cross talk originating from movement of the charge carriers is not considered. On top of that the only charge carriers which are present in the simalution are holes which drift to the strips, but presence of electrons is ommited.

In 2009 a discrepancies between cluster position in the peak and deconvolution were observed~\cite{website:backplane}.It was found out, that the disagreement is worse for thick sensors and soon the problem was identified as an issue with charge collection from whole sensor. In the deconvolution mode the charge carriers which are created close to backplane are not read as efficiently as those produced close to strips. Effectively, the material close to backplane is dead and the cluster position is shifted with respect to the peak data, where such problem is not present. To correct the cluster position betveen peak and deconvolution data, a correction called ``backplane correction'' is applied on top of deconvolution data during the reconstruction step. As in the deconvolution mode effectively the strip sensor is thinner and therefore the track shorter, this effect does not only have an effect on cluster position, but also on cluster charge and cluster width. Again, this effect is not considered in simulation.

The lines correspond to the theoretical fits, while the dots are masured data~\cite{Delaere:1061284}.  }


\subsubsection{Charge drift}

%TODO holes propagates to strips
A particle passing through the module is depositing its energy via ionization of the silicon volume. The created charge carriers then drift to the electrodes. Therefore to describe the reality, in simulation, the energy deposits, repectively charge, have to be propagated separately from each track segment to the strips. As in the barrel regions the electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the drift of the charge carriers is deflected from the direction of electric field, respectively local z-axis, by the Lorentz angle. Therefore the drift direction of the charges towards the surface of sensor must be corrected accordingly to the Lorentz angle and the local magnetic field. Morover the change carriers undergo diffusion in the silicon volume during the drift and therefore a charge from each point like segment will be at the surface collcted smeared due to diffucssion effects. To estimate the difussion, first the a drift time from the track segment to the sensor surface is comupted. This drift time depends on:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sensor thickness: the drift time is longer for thicker sensors
\item Depletion and applied voltage: influence how fast the charge carriers drift
\item Charge mobility: is dependent on environment and influences how fast the charge carriers drift, for example mobility of holes is lower than electrons
\item Coordinates of the track segment: used to determine distance charge has to drift through
\item Charge distribution RMS: no idea %TODO ask
\end{itemize}

The width of cahrge distribution is then computed from the knowledge of the drift time and a difussion constant. The diffusion constant depends on the type of material the charge drifts through and the temperature of the environment. The energy units after applying the drift and diffusion procedure are stroed as signal points, with information about its coordinates at the surface, the energy and its spread.

The diffusion is dependent on the drift time which depends on the applied and depletion voltages. These voltages can (did) chane during the operation of treacker, but were not updated in simulation. The dependecy of cluster charge, seed charge and width on depetion and applied volage is shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0AV}~\ref{fig:seedwidthTOBAV}~\ref{fig:clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0DV}~and~\ref{fig:seedwidthTOBDV}. Data, the default simulation and simulations with variations of up to $\pm 20\%$ of the depletion and applied voltage are present in these figures from which can be concluded, that withing this range of values of the depletion and applied voltage the change of cluster properties is negligible.

The diffusion constant $D$ can be expressed as

\eq{driftEquation}
{
   D=  \frac{\mu k_{B} T}{q},
}

where $\mu$ is the charge mobility, $k_{B}$ the Boltzman constant, $T$ the absolute temperature and $q$ the electrical charge of particle. Between 2017 and 2108 the temperature of the tracker was changed from -15$^{\circ}$C to -20$^{\circ}$, but this change was not propagated into simulation, therefore it is important to evaluate its effect. The cluster charge, width and seed charge are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:figures/clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0Temperature}~and~\ref{fig:figures/seedwidthTOBTemperature}. The plots of default simulation together with variations up to $\pm 20\%$ of the temperature are showing that the dependency of cluster charge, width and seed charge on temperature is negligible. The charge mobility is intrinsically also dependent on the temperature and should be also adjusted in the simulation. Figs.~\ref{fig:figures/clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0ChargeMob}~and~\ref{fig:figures/seedwidthTOBChargeMob} are revealing a change of cluster charge, width and seed charge when altering the charge mobility by up to $\pm 20\%$. This change is again negligible. In summary there is almost no change in cluster properties due to diffusion beacuse the magnitude of diffusion is much smaller than the picth size.

The Lorentz angle used in simulation is dependent on the electric field and therefore with change of voltage the Lorentz angle should be updated. The effect of the Lorentz Angle on the simulated cluster charge, width and seed charge is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0LA}~and~\ref{fig:figures/seedwidthTOBLA}. In theLorentz angle injected in simulation is specific for each module and iot is read from the consition database. The distribution of OB2 Lorentz angles per cluster was fitted by Gaussian distrinution to obtain its mean value and standard deviation. Then the mean was alterned by up to $\pm 2 \times$ standard deviation and injected into simuation to obtained the varied simulated samples. It can be concluded that within the range of injected Lorent angle values thereis small but visible effect on the description of cluster properties. Therefore within a tracker local reconstruction group there are intents to remeasure and update Lorentz angle values.

Overall the description of the drift is simplified in the simulation. It does not take into account any radiation damages of the silicon or non-unifomities of the electric filed.

\subsubsection{Induce charge on the strips~\label{sec:induce}}

Once the energy deposits in form of charge are collected on the surface, it must be simulated how much of charge is read by given strip. The charge cannot be divided between strip purely based on the geometrical critearia, due to the the capacitive coupling between strips. The capacitive coupling causes that, in the case of deconvolution mode, the charge collected by one strip is partially shared with its first and second neighbouring strip on both sides. In the peak mode, only sharing between the first neighboring strip on eeach side is observed.   

The signal point at surface is associated to the closest strip. The charge converted from energy to number of electrons, is then divided between the neighboring strips acording the charge spread orifinating from diffusion. This is done dor all signal points and after this and in case that to one strip obtains signal from more signal points, these deposits are summed. Now each strip has its assigned charged, on which the cross talk effect has to be applied. The simulation interates over all strips from left to right, and shares the charge of a given strip in between neighbors.

In the reallity, the charge is being induced on the strips already once the electrons and holes start to drift to backplane and strips, respectively, and at that time both kind of cross talks start to play their roles. The simulation decomposes these steps, first only holes towards the strips are drifted, second the charge on the strips is collected and then the cross talk caused by capacitive coupling is applied. Moreover, the cross talk could change in time due to radation damages of moules and is in principle dependent also on volatge [TODO ask]. To evaluate, what would be an impact of not corect description od cross talk, the Figs.~\ref{fig:figures/clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0coupling}~and~\ref{fig:figures/seedwidthTOBcouplig} show cluster charge, width and seed charge for seevral different cross talk configuration. In these plots we see that the cluster width and seed charge, whcih are poorly described in simulation, are strongly dependent on cross talk. The clutser charge dependence on cross talk is much weaker. To evalutae if there is a cross talk parametrization which could be injected into simulation to describe data, the matrix of simulated samples was produced. The cluster width of each sample was compared to data, based on $\chi^{2}$ test. The sample with the ebast $\chi^{2}$ is shown in light blue in Figs.~\ref{fig:figures/clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0coupling}~and~\ref{fig:figures/seedwidthTOBcouplig}. After this procedure the the data and simulation agreement in cluster width and seed charge is vastly improved, but is still not perfect as the parameters and conditions which cause minor source of disrepancies have to be updated as well. The remining non-descriptions could be then cused by simiplification of the cluster simulation. More details about the cross talk and its evaluation is given in section~\ref{figures/seedwidthTOBGeVPerElectron}. [TODO should I give more details about cross talk tuining in here and the meaning of parameters, or I will keep that to corss talk section and this general idea is enough?]

With aging of the silicon sensors the conversion between energy and electrons can evolve. The data and simulations comparisons of cluster charge, width and seed charge are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:figures/clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0GeVPerElectron}~and~\ref{fig:figures/seedwidthTOBGeVPerElectron}. Again set of simulations produced by changing the conversion factor up to $\pm 20\%$ is plotted as well. In the figures it can be noticed that change of conversion factor between deposited energy and electrons in the given range leads to significant changes in  But from the plots it can be concluded that only a change of this conversion factor would not be able to provide good data and simulation agreement in all these three quantities.

\subsubsection{Remove dead channels, add noise and convert signal to digis}

To finilaze the event few more efects must be considered. First, in the detector, several strips are dead. The information about dead channels is stored in the database, read by the simulation, and simulated charge on these channels is set to zero. Secondly, to mimic real conditions, the realistic noise has to be added to each strip. The noise per each strip is determined from the the fluctiuation of the strip charge after pedestal and CMN subtraction in data runs when no collision was present, is stored in database, and for needs of simulation read from there. The noise is storead in ADC, therefore it has to be converted to the electrons by ePerADC conversion factor. Morover because of differences between modules in detector, the noise has to be rescaled by gains of given modules to correct for module differences. The gain~(Gsim) used in simulation is determined from G1 and G2 gains measured in data, which are described in Sec.~\ref{sec:localreco}. The current choice computation of Gsim, takes G1 from data and smears G1 by random smearing to take into account differences on the sensor level.

 The summed signal and noise on the strips in electrons is then converted to ADC by ePerADC factor and scaled by Gsim to mimic output from the detector. During the reconstruction step, both data and simulation are corrected by 1/(G1$\times$G2) to eliminate module differences. Therefore it would be possible not to apply any gain on the simulated data as simulation itself no differences between same modules are intorduced. For the first simulations, indeed, no gains were applied, but later it was decided to apply gains to be able to simulate stauration effects. In FED, the charge in ADC is truncated into 8-bit range, therefore the GSim is applied to mimic the realistic output of given APV. The simulated data in ADC and then Zero Supperssed and stroed as digis.
 

The gains and noise are strongly dependent on tracker operating temperature and radiation damage and therefore they are mesured several times per year and updated regularly for needs of data reconstruction. These values are not propagated to the simulation, using values from different database, which are updated whith much smaller frequency. The difference of noise and gain between data and simulation can lead to the different zero suppresion results. If the noise is larger in one case than other, it can appear that a strip with a given charge can fail the S/N threshold criterium in one case and pass in other. This effect can lead to discrepancy in cluster width and charge between data and simulation. To evaluate current status, the cluster seed noise rescaled by Gsim, further called only seed noise, is shown in Fig.~\ref{clusterseednoiseTOB2}. From the plots it is obvious, that the difference in the seed noise between data and simulation is huge. This finding triggered the update of these conditions by the responsibles of the tracker local reconstruction group. The updated [TODO lets wait for Marco] 

Similarly as the conversion factor between energy and electrons, the conversion factor betveen electorns and ADC is sensitive to the aging of modules. The comparisons of data, default simulation and simulations with chaged eperADC factor within up to  $\pm 20\%$ from original value in the cluster charge, width and seed charge are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:figures/clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0ElectronPerADC}~and~\ref{fig:figures/seedwidthTOBElectronPerADC}. By its nature the impact on th cluster quantities is very similar as of the previous conversion factor, but again the conversion factor alone is not responsible for non-description of data by simulation.

\subsubsection{Virgin raw simulation}

Except of standard zero supperessed simulation, the tracker digitizion step brings a possiblility to simulate virgin raw data. To similate VR data, several steps needs to be added in between of the simulation steps described above. After inducing charge on strips, the APV saturation due to HIP effect can be simulated. This option is by default switched off. Then the APV baseline accordingly to the charge collected by the APV i and number of channels reading it.

\section{Improvement of the simualtion}

As identified in above sections the tuning of cross talk parameters could lead to better description of data by simulation. There are two ways how to obtain new cross talk parameters. First idea was already indtroduced in subsection~\ref{sec:induce} and it was to produce matrix of with changed cross talk parameters by step and then based on $\chi^{2}$ test evluate which simulated cluster width distribution fits the one of data. Before such tuning of cross talk it is needed to perform update of the bad channels, noise and gainsi in the simulation.

The second option is to measure cross talk parameters from data. In following, the results on the cross talk meaurement will be given and then compared with the results from the tuning of cross talk in data to simulations comaprisons.

%The first step how to imporve the description of data is update of the conditions
%-first nose gains and bad channels need to be updated
%-then plug in cross talk
%- then if neeeded tune one fo the conversion factors
%-In the previous sections several limitiations and simplifications in simulation process vere identified. In further steps the simulation could be improved to mimic more realistically hoe the clusters are created inCMS detector.


\subsection{Cross talk  measurement~\label{sec:xtalk}}

The cross talk injected in simulation was measured from CRUZET VR data at the beginning of Run~I. After identifing that outdated cross talk could lead into large discrepancies between data and simulation, we decided that the cross talk needs to be remeasured. The data used for cross talk measurement were taken in March 2018 in the virging raw mode. These data are CRUZET, meaning that the detector magnet was at 0~T that the during data taking, no collsiion was present and only cosmic muons were triggered. The trigger used during this data-taking, was first designed for triggering cosmics during collsiions, which was requested by tracker aligniment group. It was chosen becuase it increases the probability of triggering muons which pass through tracker. The CDC trigger bit~\ref{website:trigger} assumes that muon passes through whole tracker in around 30~ns, meaning that the top leg of the muon in the top part of the detector should eb seen at bunch crossing equal to minus one, and the bottom leg in the bottom part at bunch crossing eqaul to zero. Moreover the two legs should be back to back, leading to requrement on agle between the legs to be $\pi \pm 1/6\pi$. The further restrain on cosmics passing through tracker, the criteraia on phi and eta are imposed. The top leg must pass the cut $|\phi|<1/2\pi \pm 1/3\pi$ and the bottom leg $|\phi|<3/2\pi \pm 1/3\pi$, the eta of muon is required to satisfy $|\eta|<1.202$. The requirement on $\eta$ results in muons which are almost exclusively mesured by DTs and not CSCs. In totality 145854 of CRUZET VR events in runs 312627, 312972, 312973, 312974 and 312977 were taken and saved.

The data with no magnetic field are important to decompose effects of Lorentz angle from the cross talk, furthermore data need to be taken in the VR mode in order not to suppress the strips which are reading charge becasue of cross talk, but small enough to be zero suppressed. At the first step, the strategy of previous cross talk emasurement was reused. In case of no cross talk, if the track passes through volume of sensor belonging to one strip, the total charge $Q$ should be read by one strip only. But as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/crossTalk}, due to the cross talk effect, the charge will be shared to two neighboring strips on each side and the charge collected by this seed strip will not be $Q$ but only a fraction $x_{0}$.The neighboring strips will obtain smallref ractions $x_{1} and x_{2}$ of this charge. The total charge has to be conserved, leading in requirement on the fractions to be $1=x_{0}+2x_{1}+2_{x2}$. To study such charge sharing, the selection on the angle of track imposed, in order to reduce probability that the track passed through sensor area belonging to more strips. The selection on the track was chosen to be same as in previous measurement:

\eq{narrowTrack}
{
|\mathrm{tan}\theta \mathrm{cos}\phi| < 0.5 \times (pitch/thickness),
}

which is ensuring, that the track is perpendicular to the sensor plane. The track passing such criterium is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/moduleCT} and is denoted as ``accept''. On contrary tracks like the one denoted as ``reject'' are rejected by this criterium. Furthermore quality criteria on number of hits in the track larger than 6 and $\chi^{2}/dof$ of the track are imposed to select only good tracks. The cross talk can be then measured from the strip charges of clsuters originating from accepted tracks. For the purpose of the cross talk measurement, each cluster is reconstructed from pedestal and CMN subtracted digis with no truncation, as five strips wide cluster with the seed in middle. The the fraction of shared charge can be comuted as


\eq{fractions}
{
x_{i} = \frac{\eta_{i}}{1+2\eta_{1}+2{\eta_{2}}} ,
}

with $\eta_{i}$ defined as

\eq{etas}
{
\eta_{i} = \frac{q_{\pm i}}{q_{0}} = \frac{x_{i}}{1-2x_{1}+2{x_{2}}} ,
}

where i=1,2, $x_{1}$ is fraction of charge read by first neighboring strip,  $x_{2}$ is fraction of charge read by second neighboring strip and $x_{0}$ is obtained from normalization condition. The $q_{0}$ is charge read by seed strip and $q_{i}$ charge registered by the neighboring strips. In practice, distributions of $q_{\pm 1}/q_{0}$ and $q_{\pm 2}/q_{0}$ are each filled twice per clusters and  fitted separately by Guassian distributions, avoiding the tails. The mean values of these distributions are inserted in the Eq.\ref{eq:fractions} in order to comute the fraction of charge shared to neigboring strips. The results of cross talk measuremet from Run~I together with current results can be seen in Tab.~\ref{tab:measuredXtalk}. During the Run~1 measyrement, it was realized that the cross talk differes for each module geometry and thus it needs to be measured separately for each geometry. In the table only the cross talk measurement in the barrels are present, as due to the eta cut in thei chosen trigger for current data-taking, the tracks passing the disks and endcaps are suppressed.

As discussed, the observed puls shapes for the seed strip and the neighboring strips have different shapes and they peak at different time, leading to conclusion that the cross talk evolves as function of time. To test such hypothesis the timing information about muon is required. The time of muon is given at IP and details of its computation can be found in Sec.~\ref{sec:muonTiming}.  In the data acquired in 2018 two kinds of muons were observed. Ones which have hits only in top part of DTs as sketched in the left part of Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/muonTracks}, further reffered as ``top muson'',  and others having hits only in bottom part of DTs as shown in right part of Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/muonTracks}, in later reffered as ``bottom muons''. In around 90\% of cases both top and bottom muon is present in one event, they are two legs of the same muon, but both have different time. 

The goal of this analysis is to find muons which passed the IP at the same time as muon in collsion would be produced. Hawing such information it is possible to study the evolution of cross talk for muons which passed the interaction point during, before or after the collision time. The collsion muon would be produced at $time_{IP}^{InOut}=0$ and would move from IP outside exactly like the bottom muon. This is not case for top muon and terefore the timing information of the top muon is disregarded and only the time of the bottom muon is associated with the track reconstructed in the tracker. 

As also displayed in the right part of Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/muonTracks}, there are two kind of hits left in the tracker by cosmics. Ones in top part of tracker in green, reffered as ``top hits'' and others in blue in bottom part, refefred as ``bottom hits''. The timing of tracker, i.e. the sampling of a puls shape in cosmics is the same as collision and is tuned for collisions. Therefore to obtain same cross talk as in collsions, the cosmic muon has to arrive to a given module at the same time as muon from collision would arrive to that module. The situation is simple for bottom hits, for which in case of collsion as cosmic muon being at IP at same time, the arrival time to a given module has to be the same. In case of top hits, the collsiion muons goes from oputside towards the given module and then IP, while the collsion muon the direction is opposite, it starts at IP and then passses through a given module and continues towards outside of CMS. Therefore in this case both cosmic and collision muon with the same time at IP, the time when they pass given module in top part of tracker is different, and the cosmic muon arrives there before the collision one. For this reason of timing mismatch in top aprt of the tracker, only hits in bottom part of the tracker can be used.

                 { A schema of possible configuration of muon legs and hits in the tracker. }

The distribution of time and free inverse beta for the bottom legs of the muons are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figuresmutimebeta}. As expected, the free inverse beta has largest population around one, meaning, that the direction is from interaction point outwards and that the muon speed is close to speed of light. In principle cosmic muon timing should be uniform because of the random arrival time of cosmics to the interaction point. But as mentioned in~\cite{Chatrchyan:2009ig}, the trigger is efficiency is highest for muons arriving to the interaction point in time window of $\pm 5$~ns around the collision time. The time distribution in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/mutimebeta} peaks around -3.5~ns simaillarly as observed in the note on muon timing~\cite{Traczyk:1365029}. The muons with time is zero, passed the interaction point at time, the collision muon would be produced at IP. The resolution, computed as FWHM, of the time distribution is 15.7~ns. To evaluate which part of the resolution is caused by resolution of time measuremrnt in DTs, the timing distribution of muons produced in collsioni with a gaussian fit is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:figures/timeColl}. The collision muons are produced at time is equal to zero, tehrefore there is no abiguity on production time as for the cosmic muons. But still there is an assumption that muon travel at speed of light. The resolution computed from the fit is 3.6~ns. The cosmic muon timing distribution is more that four times larger because of the natural spread in cosmic arrivel times, but also bias in time can appear due to the assumption in the time computation that the muon passes through the interaction point.

The timing of tracker is tuned in a way that the cluster charge is required to be maximal. Such timing adjustments are done with particles originating from collision, thus their production time is fixed to zero. [TODO how actually is the timing optimized] Therefore to confirm that the cosmic is in alignment with the collsion one, the mean of cluster charge as a function of muon time as shown In the left plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/chargeVsTime} can be studied. This distribution was fitted with gaussian giving a mean $\mu = -1.8 \pm 0.2$, which is not comaptible with zero within its uncertainty, but the sihft is smaller than the resolution effect. There is a bias in the time measurement leading from the fact, that cosmic muons do not have to pass through the interaction point, but the muon time is extrapolated to the interaction point. Right plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/chargeVsTime} is again revealing the mean of cluster charge as a function of time, but four different cases of tracks paasing at different closest distances from the IP. The closest distance, further refferd only as ``distance'', of the track from the IP  is determined as a shortest destance between any point on the track and the IP. On the plot it can be noticed, that the meam charge at the maximum is largerst for the closest tracks to the IP. But the maxima are at the same positions, therefore the distance of the  track from IP is not causing any major shift of the chage distribution in time, but it acts more as a resolution effect.

As suggested above, the cross talk depends on time and therefore to obtain the cross talk transfereble to collsion coditions, the cross talk needs to be measured close to the time equal zero. To prove this hypothesis, the $\eta \pm 1$ and $\eta \pm 2$ distribution were filled with a cluster information from muons in 4~ns window, fitted by a gaussian, which eman was used to evaluate evolution of charge sharing as a function of time for OB2 geometry are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/etaAsTime}. Each bin of this figure corresponds to the middle of the 4~ns interval, i.e. the bin corresponding to time zero integrated over clusters from muon arriving to the IP at time window $\pm 2$~ns. The $\eta \pm 1$ and $\eta \pm 2$ distributions resulting from muons within this time window, together with the gaussian fit are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/xtalkTOB2}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/etaAsTime} it can be clearly seen taht the the charge sharing is smaller for muons arriving to a given module before a collsion particle would and larger for muons passing a given module later than particlefrom collsion would. Given this observation it is necessary to impose the selection on muon arrival time to $0 \pm 2$~ns with regard to the time resolution from the DTs.

After rejecting the muon tracks outside of the $0 \pm 2$~ns window, the evolution of the $\eta \pm 1$ and $\eta \pm 2$ as a funcion of sitance from IP can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/etaAsDist}.

The cross talk parameters are comupted from Eq.~\ref{eq:fractions} for all barrel geometries in time window of $0 \pm 2$~ns from the fit of corresponding  $\eta \pm 1$ and $\eta \pm 2$ as shown for OB2 in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/xtalkTOB2}.

In the Tab.~\ref{tab:measuredXtalk} it can be noticed, that in all cases the sharing of the charge increased. During the previous cross talk measurement, no timing information was takin into account and therefore part of the change can originate from including the time information to evaluate the cross talk. But there is also real change of cross talk due to the radiation effects. The radiation is different for each layer and as the cross talk changes with the radiation damage of the sensor, each layer within one geometry should have different cross talk. To prove this the cross talk dependency as a function of time is shown for four layers of OB2 separately. The plots were obtained similarly as plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/etaAsLayers}, but this time the time window for each bin is 6~ns in order to gain in statistics. The cross talk for all alyers is compatible within the error bars, but it can be seen, that for all points the sharing is higher for dirst two layers, than for layer three and four. The fist two layers are composed of double-sided modules, while the second two have only one side of sensors. In the double sided modules, ste sensors are back to back, therefore a particle going from IP outside is entering one sensor from strips and second from backplane. As there is a cross talk which is caused by movement of charge carriers, this cross talk could be different depending on from which side particle enters and therefore there can be a difefrent cross talk between mono and stereo side of one layer. The charge sharing as a function of time, for decomposed mono and stereo modules of OB2 layer one and two is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:figures/etaAsMonoStereo}. In these plots, du to the lack of statistics,  no clear evidence of different charge sharing dor mono and stereo layers is observed.

To evaluate if the new corss talk measuremrnt contributes to improvement of data and simulation agreement, it was injected to simualtion and compared with data and default simualtion. The cluster charge, width and seed charge distribution are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:figures/clusterchargeRescaledalll0to0XTm}~and~\ref{seedwidthTOBXTm}. In the plots it is obvious, that newly emasured parameters even worsened the overall cluster width and seed charge distribution. For OB2, the measured cross talk fractions $(x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2})$ are (0.714, 0.109, 0.034). When tuning the cross talk parameters in Sec.~\ref{sec:induce} to best describe the cluster width in data, the obtained fractions are (0.814,0.070,0.023). Therefore in data larger charge sharing is observed, than it would be needed in simulation. This could be caused by the fact, that the simulation is simplified and many parts of the simulation are oudated. Thus the cross talk in simulation is not purely describing cross talk, but it is compenseting for other effects.

In this section the results of cross talk measureemnt were shown. The cross talk parameters used in simulation were measured at the beginning of Run~I, and as shwown in this section, the cross talk changes with the aging of deetctor and therefore it had to be remeasured. It was also shown that the cross talk changes as a gunction of particle arrival time to the module, which was not taken into account during the Run~I measurements. The newly emasured cross talk did not help to improve the description of cluster charge properties of data by simualtion, elading to a conclusion, that the cross talk in simulation os compensating for other non-descriptions. To achive a good data and simulation agreement, we have decided to use the parameters in simulation which describe the data the ebst, as presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:induce}. 

The cosen approach is to first update detector conditions, which are bade channels, noise and gains and which could affect the cluster width and charge. Then the matrix of the simulations with different cross talk parameters is produced and these simulations are compared to data. The agreement between data and simulations are compared based on $\chi^{2}$ test of cluster width distribution compatibility. The cross talk parameters of sample with the best $\chi^{2}$ can then be injected into simulation. The cross talk parameters influence largely the cluster widt and seed charge, but much less the cluster charge. If after tuning there is need for better description of cluster charge or seed charge, one of the cobersion factors, either GeV per electorn or electron per ADC can be similarly tuned. These conversion factors are influencing the cluster width only slightly.


%TODO plug the measured cross talkinto the simulation
%TODO should I say sth more about other hits and tracks we do not use?
%In ideal case it would be best to acquire 0T collision VR data, which is not CMS priority. 

%actually the calue of cross talk we inject into MC can compensate for other effects and therefore does not have to agree with simualtions.
